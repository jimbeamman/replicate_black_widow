# Black Widow - Blackbox Data-Driven Web Scanning (replicated + SQL attack vector)
We have created a learning repository to replicate Black Widow's black box scanning technique. In our work, we created an SQL detection module to identify first and second-order injections, which works well on error reflection-based detections. However, further improvements are required to detect time-based or boolean-based errors.

## Setup 
1. Setup python virtual enviroment
2. Install dependency form requirement.txt
3. Download and install Google Chrome driver 
4. Setup path for Google Chrome
    - `PATH=$PATH:.`

## Run the scanner
`python3 main.py --url http://www.example.com `

## Proof of Concept for SQL injection
- use URLs generated by Black Widow as input for first-order SQL injection
- use Event genrated by Black Widow as input for second-order SQL injection
- `python3 test/sql_test.py`

## Web app docker 
- Repository of Web applications for evaluation
